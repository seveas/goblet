Goblet - git repository viewer
==============================
Goblet is a fast, easy to customize web frontend for git repositories. It was
created because existing alternatives are either not very easy to customize
(gitweb), require C programming to do so (cgit), or are tied into other
products, such as bugtrackers (redmin, github).

Goblet is currently in alpha status, so not all goals have been met yet.
Contributions are welcome, the most useful contribution is using it and
reporting all issues you have.

If you want to see goblet in action, you can find a running instance on
git.kaarsemaker.net. If you like what you see, proceed to read docs/install.rst
and enjoy!

Should you hit a problem installing or using goblet, please report it on
github. Reports about uncaught python exceptions should include full
backtraces. If the repository triggering the bug/issue is public, please
include a link to the repository and the link to the bug so I can reproduce it.
